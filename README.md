This piece of code can be used to create a password by using the SHA256 hashing algorithm with two inputs, the "Domain Key" (referred to as "general" in the code) and the "Master Key" (referred to as the "salt" in the code). The "Domain key" is used to make the hashed password specific to a website and can be the website address or some reference to the website. It doesn't matter what it is as long as you can remember it. The "Master Key" is something THAT ONLY YOU KNOW and is used as a salt during the hashing process.

I have created a web application available at [https://emmamcivor.eu.pythonanywhere.com/] that has a copy of this code and can be used to create hashed passwords outside python.
